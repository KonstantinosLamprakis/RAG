Tips on Using Git:
1. Write clear and concise commit messages (use imperative mood, e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
2. Use rebase instead of merge to keep history clean.
3. All Pull Requests (PRs) require at least 2 approvals before merging.
4. Keep feature branches small and focused on one task.
5. Always pull latest changes before pushing to avoid conflicts.
6. Use 'git stash' to temporarily save work in progress.
7. Delete merged branches to keep repository tidy.
8. Useful commands: git stash push -m "" to add message in stash, git cherry-pick to pick a spesific commit
