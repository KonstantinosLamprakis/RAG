Procedures for Iteration Planning and Retrospectives:
1. Iterations last 2 weeks and starts at Tuesdays on 8.00.
2. Planning meeting on the first day to define sprint goals and backlog items.
3. Daily standup at 9:30 AM to sync progress. They shouldn't last more that 10 mins.
4. Mid-sprint check-in to assess progress towards goals.
5. Retrospective meeting at the end of iteration to discuss what went well, what can improve.
6. Track metrics such as velocity, cycle time, and bug count.
7. Document learnings and improvements in Confluence.
8. We don't do blame-game here. If something went wrong, we build systems to make sure it will be prevented in the future.
