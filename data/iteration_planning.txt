Procedures for Iteration Planning and Retrospectives:
1. Iterations last 2 weeks.
2. Planning meeting on the first day to define sprint goals and backlog items.
3. Daily standup at 9:30 AM to sync progress.
4. Mid-sprint check-in to assess progress towards goals.
5. Retrospective meeting at the end of iteration to discuss what went well, what can improve.
6. Track metrics such as velocity, cycle time, and bug count.
7. Document learnings and improvements in Confluence.
