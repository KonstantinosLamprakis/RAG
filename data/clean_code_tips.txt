Tips on Writing Clean Code:
1. Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants and enums).
2. Write self-documenting code; comments should explain 'why' and be used rarely. Names should explain what.
3. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
4. Write unit tests for all new features.
5. Avoid deeply nested loops and conditions.
6. Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles.
7. Review code through peer reviews before merging.
8. Avoid mutating variables after the initialization.
