Tips on Writing Clean Code:
1. Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).
2. Write self-documenting code; comments should explain 'why' not 'what'.
3. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
4. Write unit tests for all new features.
5. Avoid deeply nested loops and conditions.
6. Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles.
7. Review code through peer reviews before merging.
